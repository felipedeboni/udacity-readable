# Readable Project (Front-End)

This is the final assessment project for Udacity's React and Redux course.

## Playing with server and front at once

To get started developing right away:

On root folder:
* Install dependencies with `npm install`
* Install server and front dependencies with `npm run install-all`
* start the development servers with `npm run start-all`
* running tests `npm test`
* check test stats `npm run test:coverage`

Note: only the front-end has tests

## Front

You need to be on the `front` folder

* install dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
* running tests `npm test`
* check test stats `npm run test:coverage`

## Server

You need to be on the `server` folder

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `node server`
